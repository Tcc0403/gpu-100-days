# Day 008 (2025/6/23)
- Created a directory for pytorch custom ops ([ref](https://docs.modular.com/max/tutorials/custom-kernels-pytorch))
    - Set up environment with pixi
        - To enable CUDA, we need to add system-requirements in `pixi.toml' ([link](https://pixi.sh/dev/workspace/system_requirements/#using-cuda-in-pixi))
    - Tried to add unit tests (pytest) for it (failed)
